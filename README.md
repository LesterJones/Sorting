# Sorting Algorithms

This is a collection of sorting algorithms I have implemented.

bubble_sort() -- Bubble Sort repeatedly loops through an array and swaps numbers that are out of place.  It stops when no more changes need to be made.

selection_sort() -- Selection Sort works by repeatedly selection the minimum value from an array and saving it until all values have been selected.
